# Tic-Tac-Toe
Created a web page for playing Tic Tac Toe using HTML, JavaScript, and tailwind CSS. However it cannot detected when a player wins (may
look into that in the future).
Used HTML to create the table.
Used tailwind CSS to add some colors.
Used JS to detect a click and also used a `for loop` to reset the board.
